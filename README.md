#### Setup:
* Open terminal and install Spotipy using "pip install spotipy command"
* If pip is not installed, install pip by downloading the get-pip.py file from: https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
* Then run: "python get-pip.py" in the terminal
* To verify if Pip was installed correctly type "pip -V"
* Be sure Python 3 is installed on your system

#### Runing the program:

* Go to the directory that the file is stored
* Run `python3 spotifind.py` in Terminal window
* Note that the spelling of the artist is critical, might need space/dot in between words
* Once the artist is entered, the app will open a window with the Spotify profile photo
* The program will run and when it is finished will ask you to give a number matched to a song and open a webpage with that     album cover
* The related artists will be listed close to the top of the start of the program
* The output will also contain the artist follower count, genre, and songs by album
