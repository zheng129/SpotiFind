* Be sure Python 3 is installed on your system

#### Runing the program:

* Go to the directory that the file is stored

* Once the artist is entered, the app will open a window with the Spotify profile photo

* The related artists will be listed close to the top of the start of the program
* The output will also contain the artist follower count, genre, and songs by album

#### Using the program:

* Choose 0 to search for an artist and choose 1 to exit
* After choosing 0 for searching, type in the name of the artist and make sure  spelling and space in between words, if any,  is correct
